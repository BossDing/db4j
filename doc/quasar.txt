the database is built around the concept of fibers
  - cooperative thread-like constructs
  - each database query is a fiber, allowing 1000s of concurrent queries with minimal resources

the fiber implementation was initially, and is currently, based on kilim
  - it's very well done and flexible
  - hasn't embraced new java features quickly
  - in addition to queries, the kilim http server is used for a demo

quasar is another fiber implementation
  - newer, but more corporate support atm
  - culture is not as supportive as kilim
  - has embraced new java features more quickly

i've ported the database to quasar
  - git branch: quasar

at this time, at least on grant, this branch can be checked out and run
  - java -javaagent:alt/quasar-core-0.7.4-jdk8.jar -cp "build/classes:dist/lib/*" tutorial.Hello



note
  - this file (and the quasar pom) has been back-dated to before the quasar branch
  - the alt directory contains (on grant) a .gitx that's a simple demo of quasar


(cd alt; mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=.)
ln -s ~/.m2/repository/co/paralleluniverse/quasar-core/0.7.4/quasar-core-0.7.4-sources.jar alt
(cd ../t2; jar -xf ../alt/quasar-core-0.7.4-sources.jar)

here are some of the commands used to do the port
-------------------------------------------------

grep -rl "throws kilim.Pausable" src | xargs -l sed -i -e "s/throws kilim.Pausable/throws Pausable/g"
git commit -am "quasar.prep - don't use the fqcn kilim.Pausable"
git commit --amend -a
grep -rl "import kilim.Pausable" src | xargs -l sed -i -e "/import kilim.Pausable;/ d"
